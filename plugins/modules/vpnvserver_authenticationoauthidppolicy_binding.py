short_description: Binding Resource definition for describing association between
  vpnvserver and authenticationoauthidppolicy resources
description: Binding Resource definition for describing association between vpnvserver
  and authenticationoauthidppolicy resources

options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.

    type: str
    choices:
      - REQUEST
      - RESPONSE
      - ICA_REQUEST
      - OTHERTCP_REQUEST
      - AAA_REQUEST
      - AAA_RESPONSE
    description:
      - Bind point to which to bind the policy. Applies only to rewrite and cache
        policies. If you do not set this parameter, the policy is bound to REQ_DEFAULT
        or RES_DEFAULT, depending on whether the policy rule is a response-time or
        a request-time expression.
  gotopriorityexpression:
    type: str
    description:
      - Next priority expression.
  groupextraction:
    type: bool
    description:
      - Binds the authentication policy to a tertiary chain which will be used only
        for group extraction.  The user will not authenticate against this server,
        and this will only be called if primary and/or secondary authentication has
        succeeded.
  name:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name of the virtual server.
  policy:
    type: str
    description:
      - The name of the policy, if any, bound to the VPN virtual server.
  priority:
    type: int
    description:
      - Integer specifying the policy's priority. The lower the number, the higher
        the priority. Policies are evaluated in the order of their priority numbers.
        Maximum value for default syntax policies is 2147483647 and for classic policies
        is 64000.
  secondary:
    type: bool
    description:
      - Binds the authentication policy as the secondary policy to use in a two-factor
        configuration. A user must then authenticate not only via a primary authentication
        method but also via a secondary authentication method. User groups are aggregated
        across both. The user name must be exactly the same for both authentication
        methods, but they can require different passwords.
