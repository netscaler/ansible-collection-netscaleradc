module: nd6

description: Configuration for nd6 resource.
version_added: 2.0.0
author:

options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
    type: str
  ifnum:
    type: str
    description:
      - Interface through which the adjacent network device is available, specified
        in slot/port notation (for example, 1/3). Use spaces to separate multiple
        entries.
  mac:
    type: str
    description:
      - MAC address of the adjacent network device.
  neighbor:
    type: str
    description:
      - Link-local IPv6 address of the adjacent network device to add to the ND6 table.
  nodeid:
    type: float
    description:
      - Unique number that identifies the cluster node.
  td:
    type: float
    description:
      - Integer value that uniquely identifies the traffic domain in which you want
        to configure the entity. If you do not specify an ID, the entity becomes part
        of the default traffic domain, which has an ID of 0.
  vlan:
    type: int
    description:
      - Integer value that uniquely identifies the VLAN on which the adjacent network
        device exists.
  vtep:
    type: str
    description:
      - IP address of the VXLAN tunnel endpoint (VTEP) through which the IPv6 address
        of this ND6 entry is reachable.
  vxlan:
    type: float
    description:
      - ID of the VXLAN on which the IPv6 address of this ND6 entry is reachable.

        description:
          - The mode in which to configure the bindings.
          - If mode is set to C(desired), the bindings will be added or removed from
            the target NetScaler ADCs as necessary to match the bindings specified
            in the state.
          - If mode is set to C(bind), the specified bindings will be added to the
            resource. The existing bindings in the target ADCs will not be modified.
          - If mode is set to C(unbind), the specified bindings will be removed from
            the resource. The existing bindings in the target ADCs will not be modified.
