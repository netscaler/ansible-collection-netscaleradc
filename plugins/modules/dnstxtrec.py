description: Configuration for TXT record resource.
version_added: 2.0.0

options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
    type: str
  remove_non_updatable_params:
    choices:
      - 'yes'
      - 'no'
    default: 'no'
    description:
      - When given yes, the module will remove any parameters that are not updatable
        in the resource.
      - If no, the module will return error if any non-updatable parameters are provided.
    type: str
  string:
    type: list
    description:
      - Information to store in the TXT resource record. Enclose the string in single
        or double quotation marks. A TXT resource record can contain up to six strings,
        each of which can contain up to 255 characters. If you want to add a string
        of more than 255 characters, evaluate whether splitting it into two or more
        smaller strings, subject to the six-string limit, works for you.
    elements: str
  domain:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name of the domain for the TXT record.
  ecssubnet:
    type: str
    description:
      - Subnet for which the cached TXT record need to be removed.
  nodeid:
    type: int
    description:
      - Unique number that identifies the cluster node.
  recordid:
    type: int
    description:
      - Unique, internally generated record ID. View the details of the TXT record
        to obtain its record ID. Mutually exclusive with the string parameter.
  ttl:
    type: int
    description:
      - Time to Live (TTL), in seconds, for the record. TTL is the time for which
        the record must be cached by DNS proxies. The specified TTL is applied to
        all the resource records that are of the same record type and belong to the
        specified domain name. For example, if you add an address record, with a TTL
        of 36000, to the domain name example.com, the TTLs of all the address records
        of example.com are changed to 36000. If the TTL is not specified, the Citrix
        ADC uses either the DNS zone's minimum TTL or, if the SOA record is not available
        on the appliance, the default value of 3600.
  type:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ALL
      - ADNS
      - PROXY
    description:
      - 'Type of records to display. Available settings function as follows:'
      - '* C(ADNS) - Display all authoritative address records.'
      - '* C(PROXY) - Display all proxy address records.'
      - '* C(ALL) - Display all address records.'
