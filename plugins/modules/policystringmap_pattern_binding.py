  and pattern resources

  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.

  comment:
    type: str
    description:
      - Comments associated with the string map or key-value pair bound to this string
        map.
  key:
    type: str
    description:
      - Character string constituting the key to be bound to the string map. The key
        is matched against the data processed by the operation that uses the string
        map. The default character set is ASCII. UTF-8 characters can be included
        if the character set is UTF-8.  UTF-8 characters can be entered directly (if
        the UI supports it) or can be encoded as a sequence of hexadecimal bytes '\xNN'.
        For example, the UTF-8 character '' can be encoded as '\xC3\xBC'.
  name:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name of the string map to which to bind the key-value pair.
  value:
    type: str
    description:
      - Character string constituting the value associated with the key. This value
        is returned when processed data matches the associated key. Refer to the key
        parameter for details of the value character set.
