    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

      - 'yes'
      - 'no'
    default: 'no'
    description:
      - When given yes, the module will remove any parameters that are not updatable

    type: int
    description:
      - Time, in seconds, for which a client must wait before initiating a connection
        after receiving a 503 Service Unavailable response from the SIP server. The

  rnatdstport:
    type: int
    description:
      - Port number with which to match the destination port in server-initiated SIP
        traffic. The rport parameter is added, without a value, to SIP packets that
        have a matching destination port number, and CALL-ID based persistence is
        implemented for the responses received by the virtual server.

        over SSL traffic. The rport parameter is added, without a value, to SIP packets
        that have a matching destination port number, and CALL-ID based persistence
        is implemented for the responses received by the virtual server.
  rnatsecuresrcport:
    type: int
    description:
      - Port number with which to match the source port in server-initiated SIP over
        SSL traffic. The rport parameter is added, without a value, to SIP packets
        that have a matching source port number, and CALL-ID based persistence is
        implemented for the responses received by the virtual server.
