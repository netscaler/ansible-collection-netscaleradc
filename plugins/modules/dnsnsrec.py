description: Configuration for name server record resource.

options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.

  ecssubnet:
    type: str
    description:
      - Subnet for which the cached name server record need to be removed.
  nameserver:
    type: str
    description:
      - Host name of the name server to add to the domain.
  nodeid:
    type: float
    description:
      - Unique number that identifies the cluster node.
  ttl:
    type: float
    description:
      - Time to Live (TTL), in seconds, for the record. TTL is the time for which
        the record must be cached by DNS proxies. The specified TTL is applied to
        all the resource records that are of the same record type and belong to the
        specified domain name. For example, if you add an address record, with a TTL
        of 36000, to the domain name example.com, the TTLs of all the address records
        of example.com are changed to 36000. If the TTL is not specified, the Citrix
        ADC uses either the DNS zone's minimum TTL or, if the SOA record is not available
        on the appliance, the default value of 3600.
