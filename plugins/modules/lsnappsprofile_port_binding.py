        characters. Cannot be changed after the LSN application profile is created.
        The following requirement applies only to the Citrix ADC CLI: If the name

        of the incoming packet from a subscriber. When the destination port is matched,
        the LSN application profile is applied for the LSN session. Separate a range
        of ports with a hyphen. For example, 40-90.
