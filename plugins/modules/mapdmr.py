        characters. Cannot be changed after the MAP Default Mapping Rule is created.
        The following requirement applies only to the Citrix ADC CLI: If the name
        includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation
        marks (for example, "add network MapDmr map1 -BRIpv6Prefix 2003::/96").'

        \ by one or more BRs, which provide external connectivity.  A typical MAP-T\
        \ CE will install an IPv4 default route using this rule.  A BR will use this\

        \ domain."
