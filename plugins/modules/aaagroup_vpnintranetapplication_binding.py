short_description: Binding Resource definition for describing association between
  aaagroup and vpnintranetapplication resources
description: Binding Resource definition for describing association between aaagroup
  and vpnintranetapplication resources
version_added: 2.0.0

options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.

    description:
      - 'Expression or other value specifying the next policy to evaluate if the current
        policy evaluates to TRUE.  Specify one of the following values:'
      - '* NEXT - Evaluate the policy with the next higher priority number.'
      - '* END - End policy evaluation.'
      - '* USE_INVOCATION_RESULT - Applicable if this policy invokes another policy
        label. If the final goto in the invoked policy label has a value of END, the
        evaluation stops. If the final goto is anything other than END, the current
        policy label performs a NEXT.'
      - '* An expression that evaluates to a number.'
      - 'If you specify an expression, the number to which it evaluates determines
        the next policy to evaluate, as follows:'
      - '*  If the expression evaluates to a higher numbered priority, the policy
        with that priority is evaluated next.'
      - '* If the expression evaluates to the priority of the current policy, the
        policy with the next higher numbered priority is evaluated next.'
      - '* If the expression evaluates to a number that is larger than the largest
        numbered priority, policy evaluation ends.'
      - 'An UNDEF event is triggered if:'
      - '* The expression is invalid.'
      - '* The expression evaluates to a priority number that is numerically lower
        than the current policy''s priority.'
      - '* The expression evaluates to a priority number that is between the current
        policy''s priority number (say, 30) and the highest priority number (say,
        100), but does not match any configured priority number (for example, the
        expression evaluates to the number 85). This example assumes that the priority
        number increments by 10 for every successive policy, and therefore a priority
        number of 85 does not exist in the policy label.'
