        the request/response header names and the connection will be reset for the
        other characters. When disabled allows any visible (printing) characters (%21-%7E)

    type: int
    description:
      - This option sets the satisfactory threshold (T) for client response time in

        between T and 4*T is considered tolerable. Any transaction responding in more
        than 4*T time is considered frustrating. Citrix ADC maintains stats for such
        tolerable and frustrating transcations. And client response time related apdex
        counters are only updated on a vserver which receives clients traffic.
