      - Specify the network resources that users have access to when they log on to
        the internal network. The default setting for authorization is to deny access
        to all network resources. Citrix recommends using the default global setting
        and then creating authorization policies to define the network resources users
        can access. If you set the default authorization policy to C(DENY), you must
        explicitly authorize access to any network resource, which improves security.

        access to C(ON), the local client can route traffic to its local interface.

        setting, intranet applications define the network traffic that is not intercepted.
        All network traffic directed to internal IP addresses bypasses the VPN tunnel,
        while other traffic goes through Citrix Gateway. Reverse split tunneling can
        be used to log all non-local LAN traffic. For example, if users have a home
        network and are logged on through the Citrix Gateway Plug-in, network traffic
        destined to a printer or another device within the home network is not intercepted.

      - Web address of the Web Interface server, such as http://<ipAddress>/Citrix/XenApp,
        or Receiver for Web, which enumerates the virtualized resources, such as XenApp,
        XenDesktop, and cloud applications. This web address is used as the home page
        in ICA proxy mode.
      - If Client Choices is ON, you must configure this setting. Because the user
        can choose between FullClient and ICAProxy, the user may see a different home
        page. An Internet web site may appear if the user gets the FullClient option,
        or a Web Interface site if the user gets the ICAProxy option. If the setting
        is not configured, the XenApp option does not appear as a client choice.
