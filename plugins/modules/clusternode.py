options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

  consider_non_updatable_arguments:
    choices:
      - 'yes'
      - 'no'
    default: 'no'
    description:
      - Whether to consider non-updatable arguments in the resource.
    type: str
  backplane:
    type: str
    description:
      - Interface through which the node communicates with the other nodes in the
        cluster. Must be specified in the three-tuple form n/c/u, where n represents
        the node ID and c/u refers to the interface on the appliance.
  clearnodegroupconfig:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:
      - Option to remove nodegroup config

    type: float
    description:
      - Applicable for Passive node and node becomes passive after this timeout (in
        minutes)
  force:
    type: bool
    description:
      - Node will be removed from cluster without prompting for user confirmation.
  ipaddress:
    type: str
    description:
      - Citrix ADC IP (NSIP) address of the appliance to add to the cluster. Must
        be an IPv4 address.
  nodegroup:
    type: str
    description:
      - The default node group in a Cluster system.
  nodeid:
    type: float
    description:
      - Unique number that identifies the cluster node.
  priority:
    type: float
    description:
      - Preference for selecting a node as the configuration coordinator. The node
        with the lowest priority value is selected as the configuration coordinator.
      - When the current configuration coordinator goes down, the node with the next
        lowest priority is made the new configuration coordinator. When the original
        node comes back up, it will preempt the new configuration coordinator and
        take over as the configuration coordinator.
      - 'Note: When priority is not configured for any of the nodes or if multiple
        nodes have the same priority, the cluster elects one of the nodes as the configuration
        coordinator.'
