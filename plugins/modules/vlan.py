description: Configuration for "VLAN" resource.
version_added: 2.0.0
author:
  - Sumanth Lingappa (@sumanth-lingappa)
options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.
    type: str
  aliasname:
    type: str
    description:
      - A name for the VLAN. Must begin with a letter, a number, or the underscore
        symbol, and can consist of from 1 to 31 letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-),
        period (.) pound (#), space ( ), at sign (@), equals (=), colon (:), and underscore
        (_) characters. You should choose a name that helps identify the VLAN. However,
        you cannot perform any VLAN operation by specifying this name instead of the
        VLAN ID.
  dynamicrouting:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - Enable dynamic routing on this VLAN.
  id:
    type: float
    description:
      - A positive integer that uniquely identifies a VLAN.
  ipv6dynamicrouting:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - 'Enable all IPv6 dynamic routing protocols on this VLAN. Note: For the C(ENABLED)
        setting to work, you must configure IPv6 dynamic routing protocols from the
        VTYSH command line.'
  mtu:
    type: float
    description:
      - Specifies the maximum transmission unit (MTU), in bytes. The MTU is the largest
        packet size, excluding 14 bytes of ethernet header and 4 bytes of crc, that
        can be transmitted and received over this VLAN.
  sharing:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - If sharing is enabled, then this vlan can be shared across multiple partitions
        by binding it to all those partitions. If sharing is disabled, then this vlan
        can be bound to only one of the partitions.
