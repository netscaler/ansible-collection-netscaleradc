module: gslbconfig
short_description: Configuration for gslb config resource.
description: Configuration for gslb config resource.
version_added: 2.0.0
author:
  - Sumanth Lingappa (@sumanth-lingappa)
  - Shiva Shankar Vaddepally (@shivashankar-vaddepally)
options:
  state:
    choices: []
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
    type: str
  command:
    type: str
    description:
      - Run the specified command on the master node and then on all the slave nodes.
        You cannot use this option with the force sync and preview options.
  debug:
    type: bool
    description:
      - Generate verbose output when synchronizing the GSLB sites. The Debug option
        generates more verbose output than the sync gslb config command in which the
        option is not used, and is useful for analyzing synchronization issues.
  forcesync:
    type: str
    description:
      - Force synchronization of the specified site even if a dependent configuration
        on the remote site is preventing synchronization or if one or more GSLB entities
        on the remote site have the same name but are of a different type. You can
        specify either the name of the remote site that you want to synchronize with
        the local site, or you can specify All Sites in the configuration utility
        (the string all-sites in the CLI). If you specify All Sites, all the sites
        in the GSLB setup are synchronized with the site on the master node.
      - 'Note: If you select the Force Sync option, the synchronization starts without
        displaying the commands that are going to be executed.'
  nowarn:
    type: bool
    description:
      - Suppress the warning and the confirmation prompt that are displayed before
        site synchronization begins. This option can be used in automation scripts
        that must not be interrupted by a prompt.
  preview:
    type: bool
    description:
      - Do not synchronize the GSLB sites, but display the commands that would be
        applied on the slave node upon synchronization. Mutually exclusive with the
        Save Configuration option.
  saveconfig:
    type: bool
    description:
      - Save the configuration on all the nodes participating in the synchronization
        process, automatically. The master saves its configuration immediately before
        synchronization begins. Slave nodes save their configurations after the process
        of synchronization is complete. A slave node saves its configuration only
        if the configuration difference was successfully applied to it. Mutually exclusive
        with the Preview option.
