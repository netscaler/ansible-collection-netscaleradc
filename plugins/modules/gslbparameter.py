options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.
    type: str
  consider_non_updatable_arguments:
    choices:
      - 'yes'
      - 'no'
    default: 'no'
    description:
      - Whether to consider non-updatable arguments in the resource.
    type: str
  automaticconfigsync:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - GSLB configuration will be synced automatically to remote gslb sites if enabled.
  dropldnsreq:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - Drop LDNS requests if round-trip time (RTT) information is not available.
  gslbconfigsyncmonitor:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - If enabled, remote gslb site's rsync port will be monitored and site is considered
        for configuration sync only when the monitor is successful.
  gslbsvcstatedelaytime:
    type: float
    description:
      - Amount of delay in updating the state of GSLB service to DOWN when MEP goes
        down.
      - "\t\t\tThis parameter is applicable only if monitors are not bound to GSLB\
        \ services"
  gslbsyncinterval:
    type: float
    description:
      - Time duartion (in seconds) for which the gslb sync process will wait before
        checking for config changes.
  gslbsynclocfiles:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - If disabled, Location files will not be synced to the remote sites as part
        of manual sync and automatic sync.
  gslbsyncmode:
    type: str
    choices:
      - IncrementalSync
      - FullSync
    description:
      - Mode in which configuration will be synced from master site to remote sites.
  gslbsyncsaveconfigcommand:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - If enabled, 'save ns config' command will be treated as other GSLB commands
        and synced to GSLB nodes when auto gslb sync option is enabled.
  ldnsentrytimeout:
    type: float
    description:
      - Time, in seconds, after which an inactive LDNS entry is removed.
  ldnsmask:
    type: str
    description:
      - The IPv4 network mask with which to create LDNS entries.
  ldnsprobeorder:
    type: list
    choices:
      - PING
      - DNS
      - TCP
    description:
      - Order in which monitors should be initiated to calculate RTT.
    elements: str
  mepkeepalivetimeout:
    type: float
    description:
      - Time duartion (in seconds) during which if no new packets received by Local
        gslb site from Remote gslb site then mark the MEP connection DOWN
  rtttolerance:
    type: float
    description:
      - Tolerance, in milliseconds, for newly learned round-trip time (RTT) values.
        If the difference between the old RTT value and the newly computed RTT value
        is less than or equal to the specified tolerance value, the LDNS entry in
        the network metric table is not updated with the new RTT value. Prevents the
        exchange of metrics when variations in RTT values are negligible.
  svcstatelearningtime:
    type: float
    description:
      - Time (in seconds) within which local or child site services remain in learning
        phase. GSLB site will enter the learning phase after reboot, HA failover,
        Cluster GSLB owner node changes or MEP being enabled on local node.  Backup
        parent (if configured) will selectively move the adopted children's GSLB services
        to learning phase when primary parent goes down. While a service is in learning
        period, remote site will not honour the state and stats got through MEP for
        that service. State can be learnt from health monitor if bound explicitly.
  undefaction:
    type: str
    description:
      - 'Action to perform when policy evaluation creates an UNDEF condition. Available
        settings function as follows:'
      - '* NOLBACTION - Does not consider LB action in making LB decision.'
      - '* RESET - Reset the request and notify the user, so that the user can resend
        the request.'
      - '* DROP - Drop the request without sending a response to the user.'
  v6ldnsmasklen:
    type: float
    description:
      - Mask for creating LDNS entries for IPv6 source addresses. The mask is defined
        as the number of leading bits to consider, in the source IP address, when
        creating an LDNS entry.
