description: Configuration for server record resource.
version_added: 2.0.0
author:
  - Sumanth Lingappa (@sumanth-lingappa)
options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present) the resource will be created if needed and configured according
        to the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent) the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
    type: str
  domain:
    type: str
    description:
      - Domain name, which, by convention, is prefixed by the symbolic name of the
        desired service and the symbolic name of the desired protocol, each with an
        underscore (_) prepended. For example, if an SRV-aware client wants to discover
        a SIP service that is provided over UDP, in the domain example.com, the client
        performs a lookup for _sip._udp.example.com.
  ecssubnet:
    type: str
    description:
      - Subnet for which the cached SRV record need to be removed.
  nodeid:
    type: float
    description:
      - Unique number that identifies the cluster node.
  port:
    type: float
    description:
      - Port on which the target host listens for client requests.
  priority:
    type: float
    description:
      - Integer specifying the priority of the target host. The lower the number,
        the higher the priority. If multiple target hosts have the same priority,
        selection is based on the Weight parameter.
  target:
    type: str
    description:
      - Target host for the specified service.
  ttl:
    type: float
    description:
      - Time to Live (TTL), in seconds, for the record. TTL is the time for which
        the record must be cached by DNS proxies. The specified TTL is applied to
        all the resource records that are of the same record type and belong to the
        specified domain name. For example, if you add an address record, with a TTL
        of 36000, to the domain name example.com, the TTLs of all the address records
        of example.com are changed to 36000. If the TTL is not specified, the Citrix
        ADC uses either the DNS zone's minimum TTL or, if the SOA record is not available
        on the appliance, the default value of 3600.
  type:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ALL
      - ADNS
      - PROXY
    description:
      - 'Type of records to display. Available settings function as follows:'
      - '* C(ADNS) - Display all authoritative address records.'
      - '* C(PROXY) - Display all proxy address records.'
      - '* C(ALL) - Display all address records.'
  weight:
    type: float
    description:
      - Weight for the target host. Aids host selection when two or more hosts have
        the same priority. A larger number indicates greater weight.
