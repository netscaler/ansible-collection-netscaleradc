  insertvserveripport:

        is the name that you specify for the header. If the virtual server has an
        IPv6 address, the address in the header is enclosed in brackets ([ and ])
        to separate it from the port number. If you have mapped an IPv4 address to
        a virtual server''s IPv6 address, the value of this parameter determines which
        IP address is inserted in the header, as follows:'
      - '* C(VIPADDR) - Insert the IP address of the virtual server in the HTTP header

  ipmask:
    type: str
    description:
      - IP mask, in dotted decimal notation, for the IP Pattern parameter. Can have
        leading or trailing non-zero octets (for example, 255.255.240.0 or 0.0.255.255).
        Accordingly, the mask specifies whether the first n bits or the last n bits
        of the destination IP address in a client request are to be matched with the
        corresponding bits in the IP pattern. The former is called a forward mask.
        The latter is called a reverse mask.
  ippattern:
    type: str
    description:
      - IP address pattern, in dotted decimal notation, for identifying packets to
        be accepted by the virtual server. The IP Mask parameter specifies which part
        of the destination IP address is matched against the pattern.  Mutually exclusive
        with the IP Address parameter.
      - For example, if the IP pattern assigned to the virtual server is 198.51.100.0
        and the IP mask is 255.255.240.0 (a forward mask), the first 20 bits in the
        destination IP addresses are matched with the first 20 bits in the pattern.
        The virtual server accepts requests with IP addresses that range from 198.51.96.1
        to 198.51.111.254.  You can also use a pattern such as 0.0.2.2 and a mask
        such as 0.0.255.255 (a reverse mask).
      - If a destination IP address matches more than one IP pattern, the pattern
        with the longest match is selected, and the associated virtual server processes
        the request. For example, if virtual servers vs1 and vs2 have the same IP
        pattern, 0.0.100.128, but different IP masks of 0.0.255.255 and 0.0.224.255,
        a destination IP address of 198.51.100.128 has the longest match with the
        IP pattern of vs1. If a destination IP address matches two or more virtual
        servers to the same extent, the request is processed by the virtual server
        whose port number matches the port number in the request.
