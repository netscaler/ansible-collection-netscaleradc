options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - switched
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(switched), the partition will be switched on the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

    choices:
      - 'yes'

    type: bool
    description:
      - Switches to new admin partition without prompt for saving configuration. Configuration
        will not be saved
  maxbandwidth:
    type: float
    description:
      - Maximum bandwidth, in Kbps, that the partition can consume. A zero value indicates
        the bandwidth is unrestricted on the partition and it can consume up to the
        system limits.
  maxconn:
    type: float
    description:
      - Maximum number of concurrent connections that can be open in the partition.
        A zero value indicates no limit on number of open connections.
  maxmemlimit:
    type: float
    description:
      - Maximum memory, in megabytes, allocated to the partition.  A zero value indicates
        the memory is unlimited on the partition and it can consume up to the system
        limits.
  minbandwidth:
    type: float
    description:
      - Minimum bandwidth, in Kbps, that the partition can consume. A zero value indicates
        the bandwidth is unrestricted on the partition and it can consume up to the
        system limits
  partitionmac:
    type: str
    description:
      - Special MAC address for the partition which is used for communication over
        shared vlans in this partition. If not specified, the MAC address is auto-generated.
  partitionname:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name of the Partition. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric or underscore
        (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash
        (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters.
