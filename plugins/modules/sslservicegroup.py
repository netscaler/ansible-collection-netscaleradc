options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.
    type: str
  commonname:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name to be checked against the CommonName (CN) field in the server certificate
        bound to the SSL server
  ocspstapling:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - 'State of OCSP stapling support on the SSL virtual server. Supported only
        if the protocol used is higher than SSLv3. Possible values:'
      - 'C(ENABLED): The appliance sends a request to the OCSP responder to check
        the status of the server certificate and caches the response for the specified
        time. If the response is valid at the time of SSL handshake with the client,
        the OCSP-based server certificate status is sent to the client during the
        handshake.'
      - 'C(DISABLED): The appliance does not check the status of the server certificate.'
  sendclosenotify:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:
      - Enable sending SSL Close-Notify at the end of a transaction
  serverauth:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of server authentication support for the SSL service group.
  servicegroupname:

  sessreuse:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of session reuse. Establishing the initial handshake requires CPU-intensive
        public key encryption operations. With the C(ENABLED) setting, session key
        exchange is avoided for session resumption requests received from the client.
  sesstimeout:
    type: int
    description:
      - Time, in seconds, for which to keep the session active. Any session resumption
        request received after the timeout period will require a fresh SSL handshake
        and establishment of a new SSL session.
  snienable:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of the Server Name Indication (SNI) feature on the service. SNI helps
        to enable SSL encryption on multiple domains on a single virtual server or
        service if the domains are controlled by the same organization and share the
        same second-level domain name. For example, *.sports.net can be used to secure
        domains such as login.sports.net and help.sports.net.
  ssl3:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of SSLv3 protocol support for the SSL service group.
      - 'Note: On platforms with SSL acceleration chips, if the SSL chip does not
        support SSLv3, this parameter cannot be set to C(ENABLED).'
  sslclientlogs:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - This parameter is used to enable or disable the logging of additional information,
        such as the Session ID and SNI names, from SSL handshakes to the audit logs.
  sslprofile:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name of the SSL profile that contains SSL settings for the Service Group.
  strictsigdigestcheck:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
