    description:
      - Tolerance in milliseconds. Tolerance value is used in deciding which sites

        method. The sites having the RTT value less than or equal to the sum of the
        lowest RTT and tolerance value are considered. NetScaler implements the round
        robin method of global server load balancing among these considered sites.
        The sites that have RTT value greater than this value are not considered.
        The logic is applied for each LDNS and based on the LDNS, the sites that are
        considered might change. For example, a site that is considered for requests
        coming from LDNS1 might not be considered for requests coming from LDNS2.
