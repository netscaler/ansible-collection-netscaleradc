options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present

    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

      - When disabled, translator will not insert IPv6 fragmentation header for non
        fragmented IPv4 packets
  nat46ignoretos:

    choices:

    description:
      - Ignore TOS.
  nat46v6mtu:
    type: float
    description:
      - MTU setting for the IPv6 side. If the incoming IPv4 packet greater than this,
        either fragment or send icmp need fragmentation error.
  nat46v6prefix:
    type: str
    description:
      - The prefix used for translating packets received from private IPv6 servers
        into IPv4 packets. This prefix has a length of 96 bits (128-32 = 96). The
        IPv6 servers embed the destination IP address of the IPv4 servers or hosts
        in the last 32 bits of the destination IP address field of the IPv6 packets.
        The first 96 bits of the destination IP address field are set as the IPv6
        NAT prefix. IPv6 packets addressed to this prefix have to be routed to the
        Citrix ADC to ensure that the IPv6-IPv4 translation is done by the appliance.
  nat46zerochecksum:

    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:

  td:
    type: float
    description:
      - Integer value that uniquely identifies the traffic domain in which you want
        to configure the entity. If you do not specify an ID, the entity becomes part
        of the default traffic domain, which has an ID of 0.
