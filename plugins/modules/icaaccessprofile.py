    description:
      - Name for the ICA accessprofile. Must begin with a letter, number, or the underscore
        character (_), and must contain only letters, numbers, and
      - the hyphen (-), period (.) pound (#), space ( ), at (@), equals (=), colon
        (:), and underscore characters. Cannot be changed after the ICA accessprofile
        is added.
      - ''
      - 'The following requirement applies only to the Citrix ADC CLI:'
      - If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single
        quotation marks (for example, "my ica accessprofile" or 'my ica accessprofile').
      - ''
      - Each of the features can be configured as DEFAULT/DISABLED.
      - Here, DISABLED means that the policy settings on the backend XenApp/XenDesktop
        server are overridden and the Citrix ADC makes the decision to deny access.
        Whereas DEFAULT means that the Citrix ADC allows the request to reach the
        XenApp/XenDesktop that takes the decision to allow/deny access based on the
        policy configured on it. For example, if ClientAudioRedirection is enabled
        on the backend XenApp/XenDesktop server, and the configured profile has ClientAudioRedirection
        as DISABLED, the Citrix ADC makes the decision to deny the request irrespective
        of the configuration on the backend. If the configured profile has ClientAudioRedirection
        as DEFAULT, then the Citrix ADC forwards the requests to the backend XenApp/XenDesktop
        server.It then makes the decision to allow/deny access based on the policy
        configured on it.
