options:
  state:
    choices:
      - created
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(created), the `create` operation will be applied on the resource.

    description:
      - Curve id to generate ECDSA key. Only C(P_256) and C(P_384) are supported
  des:
    type: bool
    description:
      - Encrypt the generated ECDSA key by using the DES algorithm. On the command
        line, you are prompted to enter the pass phrase (password) that is used to
        encrypt the key.
  des3:
    type: bool
    description:
      - Encrypt the generated ECDSA key by using the Triple-DES algorithm. On the
