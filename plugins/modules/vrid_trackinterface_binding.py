    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.

    description:
      - Integer that uniquely identifies the VMAC address. The generic VMAC address
        is in the form of 00:00:5e:00:01:<VRID>. For example, if you add a VRID with
        a value of 60 and bind it to an interface, the resulting VMAC address is 00:00:5e:00:01:3c,
        where 3c is the hexadecimal representation of 60.
