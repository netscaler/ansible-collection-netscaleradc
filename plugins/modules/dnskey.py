      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(created), the `create` operation will be applied on the resource.
      - When C(imported), the resource will be imported on the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

        prefix to produce the names of the public key, the private key, and the DS
        record, respectively.
