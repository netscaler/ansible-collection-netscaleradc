    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.

  dropfragcputhreshold:
    type: int
    description:
      - Threshold value, as a percentage of CPU usage, at which to drop packets that
        require fragmentation to use the IP tunnel. Applies only if dropFragparameter
        is set to NO. The default value, 0, specifies that this parameter is not set.

    description:
      - Common source-IP address for all tunnels. For a specific tunnel, this global
        setting is overridden if you have specified another source IP address. Must

      - 'NO'
    description:
      - Use a different source IP address for each new session through a particular
        IP tunnel, as determined by round robin selection of one of the SNIP addresses.
        This setting is ignored if a common global source IP address has been specified
        for all the IP tunnels. This setting does not apply to a tunnel for which
        a source IP address has been specified.
