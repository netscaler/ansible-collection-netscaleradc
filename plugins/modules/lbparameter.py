options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.

    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - This is used, to enable/disable the option of svc/svcgroup removal, if it
        is bound to one or more vserver. If it is enabled, the svc/svcgroup can be
        removed, even if it bound to vservers. If disabled, an error will be thrown,
        when the user tries to remove a svc/svcgroup without unbinding from its vservers.

      - 'ComputedADCCookieAttribute accepts ns variable as input in form of string
        starting with $ (to understand how to configure ns variable, please check
        man add ns variable). policies can be configured to modify this variable for
        every transaction and the final value of the variable after policy evaluation
        will be appended as attribute to Citrix ADC cookie (for example: LB cookie
        persistence , GSLB sitepersistence, CS cookie persistence, LB group cookie
        persistence). Only one of ComputedADCCookieAttribute, LiteralADCCookieAttribute
        can be set.'
      - ''
      - Sample usage -
      - '             add ns variable lbvar -type TEXT(100) -scope Transaction'
      - '             add ns assignment lbassign -variable $lbvar -set "\\";SameSite=Strict\\""'
      - '             add rewrite policy lbpol <valid policy expression> lbassign'

  consolidatedlconn:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:
      - To find the service with the fewest connections, the virtual server uses the
        consolidated connection statistics from all the packet engines. The C(NO)
        setting allows consideration of only the number of connections on the packet
        engine that received the new connection.
  cookiepassphrase:
    type: str
    description:
      - Use this parameter to specify the passphrase used to generate secured persistence
        cookie value. It specifies the passphrase with a maximum of 31 characters.
  dbsttl:
    type: float
    description:
      - Specify the TTL for DNS record for domain based service. The default value
        of ttl is 0 which indicates to use the TTL received in DNS response for monitors
  dropmqttjumbomessage:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:

        be dropped and the client/server connections will be reset.
  httponlycookieflag:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - Include the HttpOnly attribute in persistence cookies. The HttpOnly attribute
        limits the scope of a cookie to HTTP requests and helps mitigate the risk
        of cross-site scripting attacks.

        TOKEN, USER_TOKEN, CALLIDHASH).
  lbhashfingers:
    type: float
    description:
      - This option is used to specify the number of fingers to be used in PRAC and
        JARH algorithms for hash based LB methods. Increasing the number of fingers
        might give better distribution of traffic at the expense of additional memory
  literaladccookieattribute:
    type: str
    description:
      - 'String configured as LiteralADCCookieAttribute will be appended as attribute

  maxpipelinenat:
    type: float
    description:
      - Maximum number of concurrent requests to allow on a single client connection,
        which is identified by the <clientip:port>-<vserver ip:port> tuple. This parameter
        is applicable to ANY service type and all UDP service types (except DNS) and
        only when "svrTimeout" is set to zero. A value of 0 (zero) applies no limit
        to the number of concurrent requests allowed on a single client connection
  monitorconnectionclose:
    type: str
    choices:

        by the service's Max Clients setting. Enables monitoring to continue even
        if the service has reached its connection limit.
  preferdirectroute:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:
      - Perform route lookup for traffic received by the Citrix ADC, and forward the
        traffic according to configured routes. Do not set this parameter if you want
        a wildcard virtual server to direct packets received by the appliance to an
        intermediary device, such as a firewall, even if their destination is directly
        connected to the appliance. Route lookup is performed after the packets have
        been processed and returned by the intermediary device.
  proximityfromself:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:

        decision.
  retainservicestate:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'ON'
      - 'OFF'
    description:
      - This option is used to retain the original state of service or servicegroup
        member when an enable server command is issued.
  startuprrfactor:
    type: float
    description:
      - 'Number of requests, per service, for which to apply the round robin load
        balancing method before switching to the configured load balancing method,
        thus allowing services to ramp up gradually to full load. Until the specified
        number of requests is distributed, the Citrix ADC is said to be implementing
        the slow start mode (or startup round robin). Implemented for a virtual server
        when one of the following is true:'
      - '* The virtual server is newly created.'
      - '* One or more services are newly bound to the virtual server.'
      - '* One or more services bound to the virtual server are enabled.'
      - '* The load balancing method is changed.'
      - 'This parameter applies to all the load balancing virtual servers configured
        on the Citrix ADC, except for those virtual servers for which the virtual
        server-level slow start parameters (New Service Startup Request Rate and Increment
        Interval) are configured. If the global slow start parameter and the slow
        start parameters for a given virtual server are not set, the appliance implements
        a default slow start for the virtual server, as follows:'
      - '* For a newly configured virtual server, the appliance implements slow start
        for the first 100 requests received by the virtual server.'
      - '* For an existing virtual server, if one or more services are newly bound
        or newly enabled, or if the load balancing method is changed, the appliance
        dynamically computes the number of requests for which to implement startup
        round robin. It obtains this number by multiplying the request rate by the
        number of bound services (it includes services that are marked as DOWN). For
        example, if the current request rate is 20 requests/s and ten services are
        bound to the virtual server, the appliance performs startup round robin for
        200 requests.'
      - Not applicable to a virtual server for which a hash based load balancing method
        is configured.
  storemqttclientidandusername:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:
      - This option allows to store the MQTT clientid and username in transactional
        logs
  undefaction:
    type: str
    description:
      - 'Action to perform when policy evaluation creates an UNDEF condition. Available
        settings function as follows:'
      - '* NOLBACTION - Does not consider LB action in making LB decision.'
      - '* RESET - Reset the request and notify the user, so that the user can resend
        the request.'
      - '* DROP - Drop the request without sending a response to the user.'

  useportforhashlb:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:
      - Include the port number of the service when creating a hash for hash based
        load balancing methods. With the C(NO) setting, only the IP address of the
        service is considered when creating a hash.
  usesecuredpersistencecookie:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - Encode persistence cookie values using SHA2 hash.
  vserverspecificmac:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - Allow a MAC-mode virtual server to accept traffic returned by an intermediary
        device, such as a firewall, to which the traffic was previously forwarded
        by another MAC-mode virtual server. The second virtual server can then distribute
        that traffic across the destination server farm. Also useful when load balancing
        Branch Repeater appliances.
      - 'Note: The second virtual server can also send the traffic to another set
        of intermediary devices, such as another set of firewalls. If necessary, you
        can configure multiple MAC-mode virtual servers to pass traffic successively
        through multiple sets of intermediary devices.'
