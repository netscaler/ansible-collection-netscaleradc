options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.
    type: str
  appsprofilename:
    type: str
    description:
      - 'Name for the LSN application profile. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric
        or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore,
        hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-)
        characters. Cannot be changed after the LSN application profile is created.
        The following requirement applies only to the Citrix ADC CLI: If the name
        includes one or more spaces, enclose the name in double or single quotation
        marks (for example, "lsn application profile1" or ''lsn application profile1'').'

        IP:port (X:x), NAT IP:port (N:n), and external host IP:port (Y:y).

      - 'Available options function as follows:'
      - '* ENDPOINT INDEPENDENT - Filters out only packets not destined to the subscriber
        IP address and port X:x, regardless of the external host IP address and port
        source (Z:z).  The Citrix ADC forwards any packets destined to X:x.  In other
        words, sending packets from the subscriber to any external IP address is sufficient
        to allow packets from any external hosts to the subscriber.'
      - ''
      - '* ADDRESS DEPENDENT - Filters out packets not destined to subscriber IP address
        and port X:x.  In addition, the ADC filters out packets from Y:y destined
        for the subscriber (X:x) if the client has not previously sent packets to
        Y:anyport (external port independent). In other words, receiving packets from
        a specific external host requires that the subscriber first send packets to
        that specific external host''s IP address.'
      - ''
      - '* ADDRESS PORT DEPENDENT (the default) - Filters out  packets not destined
        to subscriber IP address and port (X:x).  In addition, the Citrix ADC filters
        out packets from Y:y destined for the subscriber (X:x) if the subscriber has
        not previously sent packets to Y:y.  In other words, receiving packets from
        a specific external host requires that the subscriber first send packets first
        to that external IP address and port.'

      - RANDOM
    description:
      - NAT IP address allocation options for sessions associated with the same subscriber.
      - ''
      - 'Available options function as follows:'
      - '* Paired - The Citrix ADC allocates the same NAT IP address for all sessions
        associated with the same subscriber. When all the ports of a NAT IP address
        are used in LSN sessions (for same or multiple subscribers), the Citrix ADC
        ADC drops any new connection from the subscriber.'
      - '* Random - The Citrix ADC allocates random NAT IP addresses, from the pool,
        for different sessions associated with the same subscriber.'

      - This parameter is applicable to dynamic NAT allocation only.

        IP:port (X:x), NAT IP:port (N:n), and external host IP:port (Y:y).
      - ''
      - 'Available options function as follows: '
      - ''
      - '* C(ENDPOINT-INDEPENDENT) - Reuse the LSN mapping for subsequent packets
        sent from the same subscriber IP address and port (X:x) to any external IP
