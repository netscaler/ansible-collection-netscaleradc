options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

  remove_non_updatable_params:
    choices:
      - 'yes'
      - 'no'
    default: 'no'
    description:
      - When given yes, the module will remove any parameters that are not updatable
        in the resource.
      - If no, the module will return error if any non-updatable parameters are provided.
    type: str
  collector:
    type: str
    description:
      - The collector should be a HTTP/HTTPS service.
  metrics:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - This option is used enable or disable metrics
  metricsauthtoken:
    type: str
    description:
      - Token for authenticating with the endpoint. If the endpoint requires the Authorization
        header in a particular format, specify the complete format as the value to
        this parameter. For eg., in case of splunk, the Authorizaiton header is required
        to be of the form - Splunk <auth-token>.
  metricsendpointurl:
    type: str
    description:
      - The URL at which to upload the metrics data on the endpoint
  metricsexportfrequency:
    type: int
    description:
      - This option is for configuring the metrics export frequency in seconds, frequency
        value must be in [30,300] seconds range
  name:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name for the metrics profile. Must begin with an ASCII alphabetic or underscore
        (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash

  schemafile:
    type: str
    description:
      - This option is for configuring json schema file containing a list of counters
        to be exported by metricscollector. Schema file should be present under /var/metrics_conf

  servemode:
    type: str
    choices:
      - Push
      - Pull
    description:
      - This option is to configure metrics pull or push mode. In push mode metricscollector
        exports metrics to configured collector. In pull mode, metricscollector only
        generates the metrics which will be pulled by external agent. No collector
        configuration is required in pull mode and it is applicable only for output
        mode Prometheus
