    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

    description:
      - The URL at which to upload the metrics data on the endpoint
  metricsexportfrequency:

    description:
      - This option is for configuring the metrics export frequency in seconds, frequency
        value must be in [30,300] seconds range
  name:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name for the metrics profile. Must begin with an ASCII alphabetic or underscore
        (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash
