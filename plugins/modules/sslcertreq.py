description: Configuration for certificate request resource.
version_added: 2.0.0

options:
  state:
    choices:
      - created
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(created), the `create` operation will be applied on the resource.
    type: str
  challengepassword:
    type: str
    description:
      - Pass phrase, embedded in the certificate signing request that is shared only
        between the client or server requesting the certificate and the SSL certificate
        issuer (typically the certificate authority). This pass phrase can be used
        to authenticate a client or server that is requesting a certificate from the
        certificate authority.
  commonname:
    type: str
    description:
      - Fully qualified domain name for the company or web site. The common name must
        match the name used by DNS servers to do a DNS lookup of your server. Most
        browsers use this information for authenticating the server's certificate
        during the SSL handshake. If the server name in the URL does not match the
        common name as given in the server certificate, the browser terminates the
        SSL handshake or prompts the user with a warning message.
      - Do not use wildcard characters, such as asterisk (*) or question mark (?),
        and do not use an IP address as the common name. The common name must not
        contain the protocol specifier <http://> or <https://>.
  companyname:
    type: str
    description:
      - Additional name for the company or web site.
  countryname:
    type: str
    description:
      - Two letter ISO code for your country. For example, US for United States.
  digestmethod:
    type: str
    choices:
      - SHA1
      - SHA256
    description:
      - Digest algorithm used in creating CSR
  emailaddress:
    type: str
    description:
      - Contact person's e-mail address. This address is publically displayed as part
        of the certificate. Provide an e-mail address that is monitored by an administrator
        who can be contacted about the certificate.
  fipskeyname:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name of the FIPS key used to create the certificate signing request. FIPS
        keys are created inside the Hardware Security Module of the FIPS card.
  keyfile:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name of and, optionally, path to the private key used to create the certificate
        signing request, which then becomes part of the certificate-key pair. The
        private key can be either an RSA or a DSA key. The key must be present in
        the appliance's local storage. /nsconfig/ssl is the default path.
  keyform:
    type: str
    choices:
      - DER
      - PEM
    description:
      - Format in which the key is stored on the appliance.

      - 'Do not abbreviate the organization name and do not use the following characters
        in the name:'
      - Angle brackets (< >) tilde (~), exclamation mark, at (@), pound (#), zero
        (0), caret (^), asterisk (*), forward slash (/), square brackets ([ ]), question
        mark (?).
  organizationunitname:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name of the division or section in the organization that will use the certificate.
  pempassphrase:
    type: str
    description:
      - '0'
  reqfile:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name for and, optionally, path to the certificate signing request (CSR). /nsconfig/ssl/

        values to be associated with a security certificate using a subjectAltName
        field. These values are called "Subject Alternative Names" (SAN). Names include:'
      - '      1. Email addresses'
      - '      2. IP addresses'
      - '      3. URIs'
