description: Configuration for simple ACL resource.
version_added: 2.0.0
author:
  - Sumanth Lingappa (@sumanth-lingappa)
  - Shiva Shankar Vaddepally (@shivashankar-vaddepally)
options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - flushed
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(flushed), the resource will be flushed on the NetScaler ADC node.
    type: str
  aclaction:
    type: str
    choices:
      - DENY
    description:
      - Drop incoming IPv4 packets that match the simple ACL rule.
  aclname:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name for the simple ACL rule. Must begin with an ASCII alphabetic or underscore
        (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore, hash
        (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-) characters.
        Cannot be changed after the simple ACL rule is created.
  destport:
    type: int
    description:
      - Port number to match against the destination port number of an incoming IPv4
        packet.
      - ''
      - DestPort is mandatory while setting Protocol. Omitting the port number and
        protocol creates an all-ports  and all protocols simple ACL rule, which matches
        any port and any protocol. In that case, you cannot create another simple
        ACL rule specifying a specific port and the same source IPv4 address.
  estsessions:
    type: bool
    description:
      - '0'
  protocol:
    type: str
    choices:
      - TCP
      - UDP
    description:
      - Protocol to match against the protocol of an incoming IPv4 packet. You must
        set this parameter if you have set the Destination Port parameter.
  srcip:
    type: str
    description:
      - IP address to match against the source IP address of an incoming IPv4 packet.
  td:
    type: int
    description:
      - Integer value that uniquely identifies the traffic domain in which you want
        to configure the entity. If you do not specify an ID, the entity becomes part
        of the default traffic domain, which has an ID of 0.
  ttl:
    type: int
    description:
      - Number of seconds, in multiples of four, after which the simple ACL rule expires.
        If you do not want the simple ACL rule to expire, do not specify a TTL value.
