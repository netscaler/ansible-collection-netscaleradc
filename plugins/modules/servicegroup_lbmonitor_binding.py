      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
    type: str
  customserverid:
    type: str
    description:
      - Unique service identifier. Used when the persistency type for the virtual
        server is set to Custom Server ID.
  dbsttl:
    type: int
    description:
      - Specify the TTL for DNS record for domain based service.The default value
        of ttl is 0 which indicates to use the TTL received in DNS response for monitors
  hashid:
    type: int
    description:
      - Unique numerical identifier used by hash based load balancing methods to identify
        a service.
  monitor_name:
    type: str
    description:
      - Monitor name.
  monstate:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED

      - Monitor state.
  nameserver:
    type: str
    description:
      - Specify the nameserver to which the query for bound domain needs to be sent.
        If not specified, use the global nameserver
  order:
    type: int
    description:
      - Order number to be assigned to the servicegroup member
  passive:
    type: bool
    description:
      - Indicates if load monitor is passive. A passive load monitor does not remove
        service from LB decision when threshold is breached.
  serverid:
    type: int
    description:
      - The  identifier for the service. This is used when the persistency type is
        set to Custom Server ID.

    description:
      - Name of the service group.
  weight:
    type: int
    description:
      - Weight to assign to the servers in the service group. Specifies the capacity
        of the servers relative to the other servers in the load balancing configuration.
        The higher the weight, the higher the percentage of requests sent to the service.
