description: Configuration for manager resource.

options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

    type: int
    description:
      - Amount of time, in seconds, for which the Citrix ADC waits before sending
        another DNS query to resolve the host name of the SNMP manager if the last
        query failed. This parameter is valid for host-name based SNMP managers only.
        After a query succeeds, the TTL determines the wait time. The minimum and
        default value is 5.
  ipaddress:
    type: str
    description:
      - 'IP address of the SNMP manager. Can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address. You can instead
        specify an IPv4 network address or IPv6 network prefix if you want the Citrix
        ADC to respond to SNMP queries from any device on the specified network. Alternatively,
        instead of an IPv4 address, you can specify a host name that has been assigned
        to an SNMP manager. If you do so, you must add a DNS name server that resolves
        the host name of the SNMP manager to its IP address. '
      - 'Note: The Citrix ADC does not support host names for SNMP managers that have
        IPv6 addresses.'
  netmask:
    type: str
    description:
      - Subnet mask associated with an IPv4 network address. If the IP address specifies
        the address or host name of a specific host, accept the default value of 255.255.255.255.
