      - Specify the congestion control algorithm to be used for QUIC connections.
        The default congestion control algorithm is C(CUBIC).
  initialmaxdata:
    type: float
    description:
      - An integer value advertised by the Citrix ADC to the remote QUIC endpoint,
        specifying the initial value, in bytes, for the maximum amount of data that
        can be sent on a QUIC connection.
  initialmaxstreamdatabidilocal:
    type: float
    description:
      - An integer value advertised by the Citrix ADC to the remote QUIC endpoint,
        specifying the initial flow control limit, in bytes, for bidirectional QUIC
        streams initiated by the Citrix ADC.
  initialmaxstreamdatabidiremote:
    type: float
    description:
      - An integer value advertised by the Citrix ADC to the remote QUIC endpoint,
        specifying the initial flow control limit, in bytes, for bidirectional QUIC
        streams initiated by the remote QUIC endpoint.
  initialmaxstreamdatauni:
    type: float
    description:
      - An integer value advertised by the Citrix ADC to the remote QUIC endpoint,
        specifying the initial flow control limit, in bytes, for unidirectional streams
        initiated by the remote QUIC endpoint.
  initialmaxstreamsbidi:
    type: float
    description:
      - An integer value advertised by the Citrix ADC to the remote QUIC endpoint,
        specifying the initial maximum number of bidirectional streams the remote
        QUIC endpoint may initiate.
  initialmaxstreamsuni:
    type: float
    description:
      - An integer value advertised by the Citrix ADC to the remote QUIC endpoint,
        specifying the initial maximum number of unidirectional streams the remote
        QUIC endpoint may initiate.
  maxackdelay:
    type: float
    description:
      - An integer value advertised by the Citrix ADC to the remote QUIC endpoint,
        specifying the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, by which the Citrix
        ADC will delay sending acknowledgments.
  maxidletimeout:
    type: float
    description:
      - An integer value advertised by the Citrix ADC to the remote QUIC endpoint,
        specifying the maximum idle timeout, in seconds, for a QUIC connection. A
        QUIC connection will be silently discarded by the Citrix ADC if it remains
        idle for longer than the minimum of the idle timeout values advertised by
        the Citrix ADC and the remote QUIC endpoint, and three times the current Probe
        Timeout (PTO).
