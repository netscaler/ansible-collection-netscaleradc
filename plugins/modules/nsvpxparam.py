description: Configuration for "VPX" resource.
version_added: 2.0.0

  - Shiva Shankar Vaddepally (@shivashankar-vaddepally)
options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

    type: str
    choices:
      - DEFAULT
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:
      - This setting applicable in virtual appliances, is to affect the cpu yield(relinquishing
        the cpu resources) in any hypervised environment.
      - ''
      - '* There are 3 options for the behavior:'
      - 1. C(YES) - Allow the Virtual Appliance to yield its vCPUs periodically, if
        there is no data traffic.
      - 2. C(NO) - Virtual Appliance will not yield the vCPU.
      - 3. C(DEFAULT) - Restores the default behaviour, according to the license.
      - ''
      - '* Its behavior in different scenarios:'
      - 1. As this setting is node specific only, it will not be propagated to other
        nodes, when executed on Cluster(CLIP) and HA(Primary).
      - 2. In cluster setup, use '-ownerNode' to specify ID of the cluster node.
      - 3. This setting is a system wide implementation and not granular to vCPUs.
      - 4. No effect on the management PE.
  kvmvirtiomultiqueue:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:
      - This setting applicable on KVM VPX with virtio NICs, is to configure multiple
        queues for all virtio interfaces.
      - ''
      - '* There are 2 options for this behavior:'
      - 1. C(YES) - Allows VPX to use multiple queues for each virtio interface as
        configured through the KVM Hypervisor.
      - 2. C(NO) - Each virtio interface within VPX will use a single queue for transmit
        and receive.
      - ''
      - '* Its behavior in different scenarios:'
      - 1. As this setting is node specific only, it will not be propagated to other
        nodes, when executed on Cluster(CLIP) and HA(Primary).
      - 2. In cluster setup, use '-ownerNode' to specify ID of the cluster node.
  masterclockcpu1:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:
      - This argument is deprecated.
  ownernode:
    type: int
    description:
      - ID of the cluster node for which you are setting the cpuyield and/or KVMVirtioMultiqueue.
        It can be configured only through the cluster IP address.
