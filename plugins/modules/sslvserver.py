      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.

  cipherredirect:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of Cipher Redirect. If cipher redirect is enabled, you can configure
        an SSL virtual server or service to display meaningful error messages if the
        SSL handshake fails because of a cipher mismatch between the virtual server
        or service and the client.
  cipherurl:
    type: str
    description:
      - The redirect URL to be used with the Cipher Redirect feature.
  cleartextport:
    type: int
    description:
      - Port on which clear-text data is sent by the appliance to the server. Do not
        specify this parameter for SSL offloading with end-to-end encryption.
  clientauth:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of client authentication. If client authentication is enabled, the virtual
        server terminates the SSL handshake if the SSL client does not provide a valid
        certificate.
  clientcert:
    type: str
    choices:
      - Mandatory
      - Optional
    description:
      - Type of client authentication. If this parameter is set to MANDATORY, the
        appliance terminates the SSL handshake if the SSL client does not provide
        a valid certificate. With the OPTIONAL setting, the appliance requests a certificate
        from the SSL clients but proceeds with the SSL transaction even if the client
        presents an invalid certificate.
      - 'Caution: Define proper access control policies before changing this setting
        to C(Optional).'
  defaultsni:
    type: str
    description:
      - Default domain name supported by the SSL virtual server. The parameter is
        effective, when zero touch certificate management is active for the SSL virtual
        server i.e. no manual SNI cert or default server cert is bound to the v-server.
      - For SSL transactions, when SNI is not presented by the client, server-certificate
        corresponding to the default SNI, if available in the cert-store, is selected
        else connection is terminated.
  dh:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange.
  dhcount:
    type: int
    description:
      - Number of interactions, between the client and the Citrix ADC, after which
        the DH private-public pair is regenerated. A value of zero (0) specifies refresh
        every time.
  dhekeyexchangewithpsk:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:
      - Whether or not the SSL Virtual Server will require a DHE key exchange to occur
        when a PSK is accepted during a TLS 1.3 resumption handshake.
      - A DHE key exchange ensures forward secrecy even in the event that ticket keys
        are compromised, at the expense of an additional round trip and resources
        required to carry out the DHE key exchange.
      - If disabled, a DHE key exchange will be performed when a PSK is accepted but
        only if requested by the client.
      - If enabled, the server will require a DHE key exchange when a PSK is accepted
        regardless of whether the client supports combined PSK-DHE key exchange. This
        setting only has an effect when resumption is enabled.
  dhfile:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name of and, optionally, path to the DH parameter file, in PEM format, to
        be installed. /nsconfig/ssl/ is the default path.
  dhkeyexpsizelimit:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - This option enables the use of NIST recommended (NIST Special Publication
        800-56A) bit size for private-key size. For example, for DH params of size
        2048bit, the private-key size recommended is 224bits. This is rounded-up to
        256bits.

    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of Ephemeral RSA (eRSA) key exchange. Ephemeral RSA allows clients that
        support only export ciphers to communicate with the secure server even if
        the server certificate does not support export clients. The ephemeral RSA
        key is automatically generated when you bind an export cipher to an SSL or
        TCP-based SSL virtual server or service. When you remove the export cipher,
        the eRSA key is not deleted. It is reused at a later date when another export
        cipher is bound to an SSL or TCP-based SSL virtual server or service. The
        eRSA key is deleted when the appliance restarts.
  ersacount:
    type: int
    description:

      - 'C(ENABLED): The appliance sends a request to the OCSP responder to check
        the status of the server certificate and caches the response for the specified
        time. If the response is valid at the time of SSL handshake with the client,
        the OCSP-based server certificate status is sent to the client during the
        handshake.'
      - 'C(DISABLED): The appliance does not check the status of the server certificate.'

        public key encryption operations. With the C(ENABLED) setting, session key
        exchange is avoided for session resumption requests received from the client.

      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of the Server Name Indication (SNI) feature on the virtual server and
        service-based offload. SNI helps to enable SSL encryption on multiple domains
        on a single virtual server or service if the domains are controlled by the
        same organization and share the same second-level domain name. For example,
        *.sports.net can be used to secure domains such as login.sports.net and help.sports.net.

      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of HTTPS redirects for the SSL virtual server.
      - ''
      - For an SSL session, if the client browser receives a redirect message, the
        browser tries to connect to the new location. However, the secure SSL session
        breaks if the object has moved from a secure site (https://) to an unsecure
        site (http://). Typically, a warning message appears on the screen, prompting
        the user to continue or disconnect.
      - If SSL Redirect is C(ENABLED), the redirect message is automatically converted
        from http:// to https:// and the SSL session does not break.
  sslv2redirect:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of SSLv2 Redirect. If SSLv2 redirect is enabled, you can configure an
        SSL virtual server or service to display meaningful error messages if the
        SSL handshake fails because of a protocol version mismatch between the virtual
        server or service and the client.
  sslv2url:
    type: str
    description:
      - URL of the page to which to redirect the client in case of a protocol version

        ticket-based resumption is enabled, and either (1) a handshake completes or
        (2) post-handhsake client auth completes.
      - This value can be increased to enable clients to open multiple parallel connections
        using a fresh ticket for each connection.
      - No tickets are sent if resumption is disabled.

    description:
      - Name of the SSL virtual server for which to set advanced configuration.
  zerorttearlydata:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - State of TLS 1.3 0-RTT early data support for the SSL Virtual Server. This
        setting only has an effect if resumption is enabled, as early data cannot
        be sent along with an initial handshake.
      - Early application data has significantly different security properties - in
        particular there is no guarantee that the data cannot be replayed.
