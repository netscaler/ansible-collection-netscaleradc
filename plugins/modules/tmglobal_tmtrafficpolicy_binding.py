      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.

        100), but does not match any configured priority number (for example, the
        expression evaluates to the number 85). This example assumes that the priority
        number increments by 10 for every successive policy, and therefore a priority
        number of 85 does not exist in the policy label.'
