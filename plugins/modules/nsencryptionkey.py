        specified method. This kind of key is
      - intended for use cases where the NetScaler both encrypts and decrypts the
        same data, such an HTTP header.

        a 64-bit (8 byte) key, with 56 data bits and 8 parity bits. C(DES) is considered

        existing applicastion. The optional mode is described below; C(DES) without

        An IV is not used. Padding is required. This mode is considered less secure

        of value n on the end of the plaintext to bring it to the cipher block lnegth.
        If the plaintext length is alraady a multiple of the block length, an additional
        block with bytes of value block_length will be added. For decryption, ISO
        10126 padding is accepted, which expects the last byte of the block to be
        the number of added pad bytes. Note that this accepts PKCS5/7 padding, as
        well as ANSI_X923 padding. Padding C(ON) is the default for the ECB and CBD
        modes.'
      - '   C(OFF) - No padding. An Undef error will occur with the ECB or CBC modes
        if the plaintext length is not a multitple of the cipher block size. This
        can be used with the CFB and OFB modes, and with the ECB and CBC modes if
        the plaintext will always be an integral number of blocks, or if custom padding
        is implemented using a policy extension function. Padding OFf is the default
        for CFB and OFB modes.'
