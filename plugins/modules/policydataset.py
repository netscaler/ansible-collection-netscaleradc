description: Configuration for TYPE set resource.
version_added: 2.0.0

options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

      - Any comments to preserve information about this dataset or a data bound to
        this dataset.
  dynamic:
    type: str
    choices:
      - 'YES'
      - 'NO'
    description:
      - This is used to populate internal dataset information so that the dataset
        can also be used dynamically in an expression. Here dynamically means the
        dataset name can also be derived using an expression. For example for a given
        dataset name "allow_test" it can be used dynamically as client.ip.src.equals_any("allow_"
        + http.req.url.path.get(1)). This cannot be used with default datasets.

  patsetfile:
    type: str
    description:
      - File which contains list of patterns that needs to be bound to the dataset.
        A patsetfile cannot be associated with multiple datasets.

        description:
          - The mode in which to configure the bindings.
          - If mode is set to C(desired), the bindings will be added or removed from
            the target NetScaler ADCs as necessary to match the bindings specified
            in the state.
          - If mode is set to C(bind), the specified bindings will be added to the
            resource. The existing bindings in the target ADCs will not be modified.
          - If mode is set to C(unbind), the specified bindings will be removed from
            the resource. The existing bindings in the target ADCs will not be modified.
