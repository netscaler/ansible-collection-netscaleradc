short_description: Configuration for Traffic Domain resource.
description: Configuration for Traffic Domain resource.
version_added: 2.0.0

options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - enabled
      - disabled
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(enabled), the resource will be enabled on the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(disabled), the resource will be disabled on the NetScaler ADC node.
    type: str
  remove_non_updatable_params:
    choices:
      - 'yes'
      - 'no'
    default: 'no'
    description:
      - When given yes, the module will remove any parameters that are not updatable
        in the resource.
      - If no, the module will return error if any non-updatable parameters are provided.
    type: str
  aliasname:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name of traffic domain  being added.
  td:
    type: int
    description:
      - Integer value that uniquely identifies a traffic domain.
  vmac:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - Associate the traffic domain with a VMAC address instead of with VLANs. The
        Citrix ADC then sends the VMAC address of the traffic domain in all responses
        to ARP queries for network entities in that domain. As a result, the ADC can
        segregate subsequent incoming traffic for this traffic domain on the basis
        of the destination MAC address, because the destination MAC address is the
        VMAC address of the traffic domain. After creating entities on a traffic domain,
        you can easily manage and monitor them by performing traffic domain level
        operations.
