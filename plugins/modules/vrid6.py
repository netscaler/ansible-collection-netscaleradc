options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.
    type: str
  all:
    type: bool
    description:
      - Remove all configured VMAC6 addresses from the Citrix ADC.
  id:
    type: int
    description:
      - Integer value that uniquely identifies a VMAC6 address.
  ownernode:
    type: int
    description:
      - In a cluster setup, assign a cluster node as the owner of this VMAC address
        for IP based VRRP configuration. If no owner is configured, ow ner node is
        displayed as ALL and one node is dynamically elected as the owner.
  preemption:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - In an active-active mode configuration, make a backup VIP address the master
        if its priority becomes higher than that of a master VIP address bound to
        this VMAC address.
      - '             If you disable pre-emption while a backup VIP address is the
        master, the backup VIP address remains master until the original master VIP''s
        priority becomes higher than that of the current master.'
  preemptiondelaytimer:
    type: int
    description:
      - Preemption delay time in seconds, in an active-active configuration. If any
        high priority node will come in network, it will wait for these many seconds
        before becoming master.
  priority:
    type: int
    description:
      - Base priority (BP), in an active-active mode configuration, which ordinarily
        determines the master VIP address.
  sharing:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ENABLED
      - DISABLED
    description:
      - In an active-active mode configuration, enable the backup VIP address to process
        any traffic instead of dropping it.
  trackifnumpriority:
    type: int
    description:
      - Priority by which the Effective priority will be reduced if any of the tracked
        interfaces goes down in an active-active configuration.
  tracking:
    type: str
    choices:
      - NONE
      - ONE
      - ALL
      - PROGRESSIVE
    description:
      - The effective priority (EP) value, relative to the base priority (BP) value
        in an active-active mode configuration. When EP is set to a value other than
        None, it is EP, not BP, which determines the master VIP address.
      - 'Available settings function as follows:'
      - '* C(NONE) - No tracking. EP = BP'
      - '* C(ALL) -  If the status of all virtual servers is UP, EP = BP. Otherwise,
        EP = 0.'
      - '* C(ONE) - If the status of at least one virtual server is UP, EP = BP. Otherwise,
        EP = 0.'
      - '* C(PROGRESSIVE) - If the status of all virtual servers is UP, EP = BP. If
        the status of all virtual servers is DOWN, EP = 0. Otherwise EP = BP (1 -
        K/N), where N is the total number of virtual servers associated with the VIP
        address and K is the number of virtual servers for which the status is DOWN.'
