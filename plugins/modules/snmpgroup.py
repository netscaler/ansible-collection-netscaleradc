      - present

    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.

      - 'Name for the SNMPv3 group. Can consist of 1 to 31 characters that include
        uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-), period (.) pound
        (#), space ( ), at sign (@), equals (=), colon (:), and underscore (_) characters.  You
        should choose a name that helps identify the SNMPv3 group. '
      - '            '
      - 'The following requirement applies only to the Citrix ADC CLI:'
      - If the name includes one or more spaces, enclose it in double or single quotation
        marks (for example, "my name" or 'my name').
  readviewname:
    type: str
    description:
      - Name of the configured SNMPv3 view that you want to bind to this SNMPv3 group.
        An SNMPv3 user bound to this group can access the subtrees that are bound
        to this SNMPv3 view as type INCLUDED, but cannot access the ones that are
        type EXCLUDED. If the Citrix ADC has multiple SNMPv3 view entries with the
        same name, all such entries are associated with the SNMPv3 group.

      - authPriv

      - 'Security level required for communication between the Citrix ADC and the
        SNMPv3 users who belong to the group. Specify one of the following options:'
      - C(noAuthNoPriv). Require neither authentication nor encryption.
      - C(authNoPriv). Require authentication but no encryption.
      - C(authPriv). Require authentication and encryption.
      - 'Note: If you specify authentication, you must specify an encryption algorithm
        when you assign an SNMPv3 user to the group. If you also specify encryption,
        you must assign both an authentication and an encryption algorithm for each
        group member.'
