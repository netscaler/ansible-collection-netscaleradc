description: Configuration for HMAC key resource.
version_added: 2.0.0

options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - absent
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

    description:
      - 'The hex-encoded key to be used in the HMAC computation. The key can be any
        length (up to a Citrix ADC-imposed maximum of 255 bytes). If the length is
        less than the digest block size, it will be zero padded up to the block size.
        If it is greater than the block size, it will be hashed using the digest function
        to the block size. The block size for each digest is:'
      - '   MD2    - 16 bytes'
      - '   MD4    - 16 bytes'
      - '   MD5    - 16 bytes'
      - '   SHA1   - 20 bytes'
      - '   SHA224 - 28 bytes'
      - '   SHA256 - 32 bytes'
      - '   SHA384 - 48 bytes'
      - '   SHA512 - 64 bytes'
      - Note that the key will be encrypted when it it is saved
      - ''
      - There is a special key value AUTO which generates a new random key for the
        specified digest. This kind of key is
      - intended for use cases where the NetScaler both generates and verifies an
        HMAC on  the same data.

      - '   The rest of the characters must be alpha, numeric (0-9) or underscores.'
      - '   It cannot be re or xp (reserved for regular and XPath expressions).'
      - '   It cannot be an expression reserved word (e.g. SYS or HTTP).'
      - '   It cannot be used for an existing expression object (HTTP callout, patset,
        dataset, stringmap, or named expression).'
