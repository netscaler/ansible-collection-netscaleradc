      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(absent), the resource will be deleted from the NetScaler ADC node.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

      - Name for the user-defined cipher group. Must begin with an ASCII alphanumeric
        or underscore (_) character, and must contain only ASCII alphanumeric, underscore,
        hash (#), period (.), space, colon (:), at (@), equals (=), and hyphen (-)
        characters. Cannot be changed after the cipher group is created.

  ciphgrpalias:
    type: str
    description:
      - The individual cipher name(s), a user-defined cipher group, or a system predefined
        cipher alias that will be added to the  predefined cipher alias that will
        be added to the group cipherGroupName.
      - If a cipher alias or a cipher group is specified, all the individual ciphers
        in the cipher alias or group will be added to the user-defined cipher group.

        description:
          - The mode in which to configure the bindings.
          - If mode is set to C(desired), the bindings will be added or removed from
            the target NetScaler ADCs as necessary to match the bindings specified
            in the state.
          - If mode is set to C(bind), the specified bindings will be added to the
            resource. The existing bindings in the target ADCs will not be modified.
          - If mode is set to C(unbind), the specified bindings will be removed from
            the resource. The existing bindings in the target ADCs will not be modified.
