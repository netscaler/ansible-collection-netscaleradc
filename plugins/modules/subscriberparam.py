description: Configuration for Subscriber Params resource.

options:
  state:
    choices:
      - present
      - unset
    default: present
    description:
      - The state of the resource being configured by the module on the NetScaler
        ADC node.
      - When C(present), the resource will be added/updated configured according to
        the module's parameters.
      - When C(unset), the resource will be unset on the NetScaler ADC node.

    choices:
      - 'yes'
      - 'no'
    default: 'no'
    description:
      - Whether to consider non-updatable arguments in the resource.
    type: str
  idleaction:
    type: str
    choices:
      - ccrTerminate
      - delete
      - ccrUpdate
    description:
      - q!Once idleTTL exprires on a subscriber session, Citrix ADC will take an idle
        action on that session. idleAction could be chosen from one of these ==>
      - '1. C(ccrTerminate): (default) send CCR-T to inform PCRF about session termination
        and C(delete) the session.  '
      - '2. C(delete): Just C(delete) the subscriber session without informing PCRF.'
      - '3. C(ccrUpdate): Do not C(delete) the session and instead send a CCR-U to
        PCRF requesting for an updated session. !'
  idlettl:
    type: float
    description:
      - 'q!Idle Timeout, in seconds, after which Citrix ADC will take an idleAction
        on a subscriber session (refer to ''idleAction'' arguement in ''set subscriber
        param'' for more details on idleAction). Any data-plane or control plane activity
        updates the idleTimeout on subscriber session. idleAction could be to ''just
        delete the session'' or ''delete and CCR-T'' (if PCRF is configured) or ''do
        not delete but send a CCR-U''. '
      - Zero value disables the idle timeout. !
  interfacetype:
    type: str
    choices:
      - None
      - RadiusOnly
      - RadiusAndGx
      - GxOnly
    description:
      - Subscriber Interface refers to Citrix ADC interaction with control plane protocols,
        RADIUS and GX.
      - 'Types of subscriber interface: NONE, C(RadiusOnly), C(RadiusAndGx), C(GxOnly).'
      - 'NONE: Only static subscribers can be configured.'
      - 'C(RadiusOnly): GX interface is absent. Subscriber information is obtained
        through RADIUS Accounting messages.'
      - 'C(RadiusAndGx): Subscriber ID obtained through RADIUS Accounting is used
        to query PCRF. Subscriber information is obtained from both RADIUS and PCRF.'
      - 'C(GxOnly): RADIUS interface is absent. Subscriber information is queried
        using Subscriber IP or IP+VLAN.'
  ipv6prefixlookuplist:
    type: list
    description:
      - The ipv6PrefixLookupList should consist of all the ipv6 prefix lengths assigned
        to the UE's'
    elements: int
  keytype:
    type: str
    choices:
      - IP
      - IPANDVLAN
    description:
      - Type of subscriber key type C(IP) or C(IPANDVLAN). C(IPANDVLAN) option can
        be used only when the interfaceType is set to gxOnly.
      - Changing the lookup method should result to the subscriber session database
        being flushed.
